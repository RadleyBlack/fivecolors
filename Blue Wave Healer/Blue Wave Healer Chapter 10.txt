Maiho briefly closed her eyes, then tried to disentangle herself from Laivo, but Laivo refused to let go. She was surprisingly strong.

“Time to get back to work,” whispered Maiho.

“You have already done enough. You’re exhausted,” insisted Laivo.

“The work is not going to get done by itself. There are all those patients that didn’t get treated because I was busy with Raeha and I also have to stop Huglek killing off the senior families.”

“The aides have treated all the patients. They can all wait a little before they really need the altar. As for the senior families, let Huglek kill them. What have they ever done for the village?" argued Laivo.

Maiho cupped Laivo's cheek and tilted her head so she could look into her eyes. "Do you really want the nest's corridors to flow red with blood? Do you have any idea how much death and destruction a Singer can inflict upon others?" she asked. 

Laivo stared back defiantly before blushing and looking away. “You need to look after yourself for once,” she said hoarsely.  Maiho frowned and looked more closely at Laivo. Her eyes were glowing and her hair was standing up. She had a wild crazed look. Maiho wondered if this was what people saw when they looked at her.

Maiho had never given that much vitality to anyone before and Laivo was not used to it. “Are you okay?”

Laivo licked her lips and looked down and to the left. “I have never felt better,” she breathed. “I’m all tingly. I feel like I can lift mountains, crush rocks. I feel wonderful.” She touched her lips. “Do I have the lips?" she asked.

"The lips?" asked a confused Maiho.

"My mother has blue lips. Have mine gone blue?"

At first Maiho didn't understand and then she did. "Oh. Oh! Umm no. That kind of thing usually takes a few hours, at least it did with Bardre."

"You did it with Bardre?"

"No. Similar effect, different umm. Never mind. So how did your mother - ?”

“Viune.”

“Thank the gods.”

“Who did you think - ?”

“Never mind,” Maiho said closing off the conversation before it became even more embarrassing. She rolled and twisted, dumping Laivo on the floor.

“Hey!”

“The village isn’t going to save itself,” said Maiho, adjusting her beech-clout so that it covered her. She strode to the door, leaving Laivo to catch up. She almost ran into a guard as she opened the door.

“Sorry Instructor. Belshat is here,” said the guard hurriedly sidestepping.

“Put him in the big meeting room,” Maiho instructed. Tell him that I will be with him shortly. When Thiona and Foenad arrive, put them in the same room. Where are Maksim and Nolwark?” 

“Consulting Room 4,” replied the guard.

“Do you really think Thiona and Foenad will come?” asked Laivo. “I’m amazed that Belshat came.”

“They will all be nervous about Huglek, afraid he’ll come after them next,” said Maiho. “They’ll come.” Turning to the guard she asked, “Can you find Tagran for me?”

“I don’t know what he looks like,” said the guard.

“He’s the Head Healer’s Aide here. His rank necklace will have one blue, one green and one white crystal,” advised Maiho.

“I think I’ve seen him.”

“Good, I’ll be in Consulting Room 4. Tell him to meet me there,” she replied. She headed towards room 4. She paused at the door and turned to Laivo asking. “Can you look scary?” 

Laivo responded by giving a grimace. Maiho shook her head “That just makes you look constipated. Try looking predatory, like you want to eat the other person.”

Laivo batted her eyelids and looked coy.

Maiho groaned. “Never mind, just be yourself. The eyes and hair will probably make them soil their beech-clouts anyway.”

“The way you look, they will be so terrified of you, they won’t even notice me,” said Laivo. With a slam of her palm, the door swung open and they entered the room.


——

Later, they headed for the big meeting room. When they entered the room, Belshat was pacing nervously while Foenad was seated at the table.

“Naedri’s mercy! There are two of them!” exclaimed Foenad.

Belshat spun around and did a double take. “What’s wrong with your eyes?” he asked.

“It’s a side effect of saving Raeha’s life. It wasn’t easy,” replied Maiho.

“Raeha’s alive?! Huglek was screaming outside Huifa’s place that Huifa had killed her.” Belshat exclaimed.

“She did, but I brought her back,” announced Maiho.

Belshat raised his eyebrows in disbelief. “I never know when you are being serious,” he confessed. He frowned. “Are you going to look like that from now on?” he asked.

“You have bigger problems. I wouldn’t worry about this if I were you,” stated Maiho, indicating her eyes.

“What are you going to do about that madman who is threatening to kill my aunt?” asked Foenad.

“Why would I do anything about that?” asked Maiho.

“Your message said - “ began Foenad.

“I will help you resolve matters, but it will cost you,” stated Maiho.

“We are willing to pay 300 rods to get rid of him,” responded Foenad.

Maiho sighed. “Not that kind of cost,” she warned. “Huifa will resign as head of your family in favour of you. She will be put on trial for conspiracy to commit murder. She will be sentenced to 30 hundred-days of enslavement.”

“Why don’t you ask for 100 hundred-days?” asked Foenad, bitterly. “My aunt is 64. She doesn’t have 30 hundred-days left.”

“We didn’t come here for you to play games with us,” said Belshat, pushing past them. “If you are not going to be serious, I’m leaving.”

“I wouldn't go out there if I were you,” said Maiho. “You might run into Huglek.”

Belshat froze with his hand on the door handle. Thiona slammed the door into Belshat as she entered the room, sending him staggering back.

“What did I miss?” asked Thiona, ignoring Belshat. Only a slight smile betrayed that she realised that she had hit him with the door.

“Belshat and Foenad were just telling me that they would rather Huifa die than pay for her crimes,” said Maiho.

“That’s not – “ started Foenad.

“The bitch doesn’t have enough skin to flay in order to pay for all her crimes,” interrupted Thiona. “What has the screecher done now?”

“Show some respect,” said Belshat. “She is a senior family head.”

“Well I am too,” said Thiona. “But when has that magma snake ever shown {b}me{/b} any respect?”

“Shall we all sit down?" suggested Maiho.

“Is Huglek really here or was that another one of your games?” asked Belshat.

“Oh, he’s here alright,” said Thiona. “I just ran into to him. He’s visiting his wife. She’s ill.”

Belshat turned pale.

“Sit down Belshat,” commanded Maiho. Belshat was so shaken that he actually obeyed, sitting down in the next chair and placing his head in his hands.

“Who is the twitch with the matching hair and eyes?” asked Thonia, pointing to Laivo.

“This is trainee healer Laivo,” said Maiho, “I’m showing her the ropes. We discussed Laivo’s appointment in the meeting you walked out of.” Laivo grimaced and opened her mouth to contradict Maiho. Maiho reached out and touched her hand, using the colour in her body as if it were a message crystal. “Play along,” Maiho sent to her. Laivo was so startled by a buzzing sensation and Maiho’s distorted disembodied voice whispering in her ear that she gaped open mouthed for a few seconds.

“And why do both of you look like ghosts in a bad play?” asked Thiona.

“It’s due to the after effects of an intense healing session,” answered Maiho.

“Can we stop with the polite, but meaningless, chit-chat and get on with the matter at hand?” asked Foenad.

“What do you want to talk about? Whether we are going to give into Maiho’s demands and make Huifa a scapegoat or allow Huglek to continue to wage war on the 4th family?” asked Belshat, in a morose tone.

“Things haven’t degenerated that far, have they?” asked Foenad.

“Oh! This meeting is much more interesting than the last one,” said Thiona. “I vote we scape the goat out of that witch. What {b}is{/b} a scapegoat by the way?”

“I don’t know, I’m not an Archivist. All I know is that they get blamed for things,” sighed Belshat.

“Why don’t we leave her out in the sunlight? Or burn her?” asked Thiona. “I’ll provide the wood.”

“You’re not as funny as you think you are Thiona,” said Belshat.

“There has to be another way,” said Foenad. “Are you telling me that the entire strength of the senior families can’t deal with an old ex-priest?”

“The demand for Huifa’s enslavement, is that coming from you or Huglek?” asked Belshat, looking at Maiho.

“I’m acting for Huglek,” replied Maiho.

“That’s an interesting choice of words. If we agree to offer up Huifa and let her be enslaved, will Huglek agree that the matter is closed?” asked Belshat.

“Belshat! We’re not charterless bandits. The village charter guarantees a trial,” protested Foenad.

“We have more than enough evidence to convict Huifa,” said Maiho. “That’s no problem. The problem is that trials go awry when the senior families are involved. In this case I want your guarantee that the trial will go smoothly and without interference.”

“So what exactly did Huifa do?” asked Thiona. “Does it have something to do with why there is a bunch of shard hunters hanging out in front of Huifa’s place?”

“Shard hunters! I didn’t hear about those. Does Huglek have shard hunters?” asked Belshat.

“The shard hunters are mine,” said Maiho.

“You’re helping Huglek?” asked Foenad.

“How did you get shard hunters?” asked Thiona “There hasn’t been a caravan with shard hunters for several hundred days.”

“I’m helping the senior families and Huglek resolve their differences,” said Maiho.

“It sounds as if you’re helping Huglek more than the Families. And you still haven’t explained what happened,” said Thiona.

“Belshat and Huifa sent ten enforcers and two lookouts to waylay Huglek and kill him,” said Maiho.

“I had nothing to do with that,” protested Belshat.

“I have witnesses who say otherwise,” said Maiho.

“I didn’t think you and Huifa had the guts,” said Thiona. “I thought you would do {b}nothing{\b} as usual.”

“Oh, I wouldn’t say they have been doing nothing,” contradicted Maiho.

“I tried to convince Huifa that it was a bad idea. Did your so-called witnesses tell you that?” asked Belshat, ignoring Thiona.

“You only did so because you thought it was too risky,” said Maiho. “Huifa wanted to send three enforcers. You convinced her to send ten. You even lent her three enforcers and a lookout for the job.”

“How did you scrounge up three enforcers - ?” started Thiona.

“When he had lost so many people in clashes with my parents and me that he had to borrow a couple enforcers from you?” finished Maiho. “That’s simple. He lent your enforcers to Huifa.”

“You promised you wouldn’t use them against Singers,” accused Thiona.

“Actually, I only promised not to use them against Maiho,” countered Belshat.

“What kind of fool do you think I am?” shouted Thiona. “That nonsense wouldn’t satisfy a five hundred day old.”

“You are always criticizing us for not doing enough. Well, we did something,” retorted Belshat.

“You treat me like a poor cousin, always telling me that I am too rash and too inexperienced. Well what has your great wisdom and experience brought us Belshat?” said Thiona. “Huglek looked pretty good when I just talked to him.”

Belshat gritted his teeth, but said nothing. 

“If Huglek is here, what has happened to my Aunt” asked Foenad. “Wasn’t Huglek in her apartment, trying to - “

“Huifa is still holed up in her apartment. She is not going anywhere,” said Maiho.

“Lets hear the rest of it,” said Thiona. “What happened to my men?”

“The lookouts both survived. Foenad and Belshat, it would be good for us talk to them. They should be able to add details to the sequence of events,” said Maiho. “Can you two find them and present them at a follow-up meeting?”

“Why would we do that?” asked Belshat.

“If you trust my version of events, I guess there is no real reason to,” said Maiho doubtfully.  But they wouldn’t trust her, they would argue far into Dawn Sleep and she needed to wake early to meet with Nargre and her friends.

“Just get on with it,” demanded Thiona. 

“Two of the enforcers were captured when they sought a healer’s help at this clinic.” said Maiho. “The remaining eight enforcers are probably dead. The guard is still collecting body parts from the scene of the conflict. The dead probably include your enforcers Thiona. I’m sorry.”

“Ragloc was my cousin. Jurlen has worked for the family since he was a child,” said Thiona.

“We have all lost people, Thiona,” said Belshat.

“Daylight burn you, Belshat. This is all your fault,” shouted Thiona.

“Huglek’s wife Raeha was shot with a crossbow during the conflict. The fact that she is still alive is the only reason he is willing to let you all live,” said Maiho.

“We don’t respond well to threats,” said Thiona.

“That wasn’t a threat, just a statement of fact,” said Maiho.

“How did Huglek manage to ambush the, umm team?” asked Thiona, “And where did he get the muscle to take down ten enforcers?”

“The Family kill team ambushed Huglek,” answered Maiho. “He was taken completely by surprise.”

“Then who killed the enforcers?” asked Thiona.

“Huglek and his wife did,” said Maiho.

“Just two people against ten,” queried Thiona.

“Two Singers against 10 non-singers,” said Maiho. “Your thugs didn’t stand a chance.”

“Tube slush! Even with a powerful weapon that would be impossible,” retorted Thiona.

“And Huglek’s wife isn’t a Singer,” added Foenad.

“Huglek was senior priest for tens of hundred-days, in that time don’t you think he would have acquired a crystal weapon,” said Maiho. “As for Raeha, she is healer caste, and like all members of any of the singer castes, she has been trained to sing.”

“I still don’t believe it,” stated Thiona.

“What is there to believe?” asked Maiho, in annoyance. “You are too used to dealing with push overs like Logwan and non-political healers like my mother. You have forgotten how dangerous Viune was, people were afraid of her for a reason. Did you think that all the stories people tell about her were just that, only stories? If Huglek hadn’t been taken by surprise he would have be able to kill all of your little murder squad with ease. He is not going to be taken by surprise again.” Her eyes flicked to the door, her sensitive hearing giving her advanced warning. The door opened and two guards escorted Nolwark in.

“This is one of the two survivors of the altercation,” explained Maiho. “Nolwark, would you explain what happened?”

Nolwark’s eyes flickered around the room, each. face he saw seemed to frighten him more than the last. He twisted in the guards’ grip, searching for a way to escape.

“It’s okay Nolwark. No one is going to hurt you here,” assured Maiho. “Just tell your story.”

Nolwark licked his lips and swallowed. 

“How did you find Huglek and his wife?” prompted Maiho.

“There’s a restaurant they go to. We hit them as they came out of the restaurant. Bagtav and Menfus went in with knives,” said Nolwark.

“I told you to use crossbows,” exclaimed Belshat.

Everyone looked at Belshat. He shrunk down in his seat.

“Too many things can go wrong with a crossbow,” said Nolwark. “It is easier to control the situation with a knife.”

“When Bagtav and Menfus closed on the pair, the girl grabbed her flute except it wasn’t a flute that came out of the flute holder. It looked like a shock wand but when she sang and hit Bagtav with it he fell down dead. I’ve never seen a shock wand do that.”

“How lethal a shock wand is depends on how strong the Singer is. Raeha is quite strong,” observed Maiho.

“She isn’t a Singer. It is illegal for her to sing,” said Thiona with a frown.

“It is completely legal for a singer caste member to sing under the supervision of the Song Master. Or do you think that her husband is likely to refuse her permission?” asked Maiho.

“Your father wasn’t supervised by the Song Master when he shocked poor Natlard,” complained Belshat. “He still has not completely recovered. Winfur hasn’t recovered from what your mother did to him either.”

“If I had realised earlier exactly why Natlard and Winfur were banned from the clinic, they would have other problems,” said Maiho. When Nolwark had described how well her parents had fared when they were threatened by Belshat’s thugs, she had been surprised. She had not been aware that her father carried a shock wand or knew how to use it. It also sounded as if her mother had used reverse healing on the other assailant. That was a technique that she wouldn’t have thought her mother had the skill to use. “They are both free to complain to the guard. Of course, they might have to explain why they attacked my parents.”

“They only wanted to talk,” said Belshat.

“Threaten and intimidate more likely,” said Maiho.

“None of this helps my aunt,” complained Foenad. “We are willing to admit fault and pay compensation.”

“I have already told you the price,” stated Maiho.

“She is an old woman. Surely you can’t be so heartless as to inflict this on her?” whined Foenad.

“This is the fourth time in the last few five-days that senior family enforcers have attacked Singers and or their families. This time Raeha actually died, and although I saved her the odds of her making a significant recovery are not good. We have run out of patience. There must be real payment this time,” said Maiho. “Besides, Huglek still wants Huifa dead. Now is a good time to ask for mercy. He is still grateful that she is alive and has not given up hope that she will recover. If you wait too long her life will not be worth a cracked chip”.

“This is how you help us resolve the matter?! By making threats?” asked Foenad.

“I could just let Huglek kill you all,” said Maiho.

“Let him try,” blustered Foenad.

“You should listen to the rest of Nolwark’s story before you decide to do that,” suggested Maiho. She nodded at Nolwark to continue.

“The girl laid about with her shock wand, and both Bagtav and Menfus went down. Because of this, Huglek had time to draw a crystal weapon. Rendec, Gadnow and Coblug just came apart in fountains of blood.”

“What do you mean fountains of blood?” asked Thiona. “People don’t just explode for no reason.”

Nolwark looked at Maiho, uncertain how to describe what he had seen.

“Was the weapon similar to this?” asked Maiho, pulling out the needle flinger that she had obtained from Huglek at the council meeting, out of her bag.

“Yes, but it was bigger,” responded Nolwark, grateful at being asked a question that he could answer.

“This weapon fires crystal needles,” said Maiho. “In the hands of a Singer as strong as Huglek it will not only be fatal to anyone Huglek aims it at, but it will also make a mess of the body. You can examine what is left of Huifa’s murder squad after the guard has found all the pieces.”

“That’s okay,” said Belshat hurriedly. “We’ll take your word for it.”

“Speak for yourself,” retorted Thiona.

“Are we just going to let her throw around accusations like murder squad?” complained Foenad.

“Shut up, Foenad,” ordered Belshat.

“What about Ragloc and Jurlen?” Thiona asked Nolwark.

Nolwark look away. “Sorry, I didn’t see what happen to them,” he said. “I happened so fast.” 

“Did you see Raeha get shot?” asked Maiho.

“No. I saw Huglek take a quarrel to the shoulder though.  Maksim was hit and I dragged him to safety. I was hit in the arm as I dragged him into a side corridor,” said Nolwark.

“It was probably a ricochet otherwise you probably would have lost your arm,” commented Maiho. Nolwark hadn’t mentioned that before. Huglek had been covered with blood when he had carried in Raeha dyspite this she would have still noticed if he had a major wound. Was Huglek powerful enough for his wounds to heal automatically? If he was carrying enough vitality he would be, she decided.

“So you ran,” accused Foenad. “Why should we trust anything you say? You Dis-forsworn coward.”

“I had to take Maksim to the clinic.” said Nolwark looking at the floor. “He could have died.” 

“You both would have died if you were a fraction slower,” said Maiho. “Foenad, stop trying to intimidate the witness. Nolwark, both you and Maksim will be protected, there is no reason to be afraid.”

“It’s you who has threatened and bribed him to tell these ridiculous lies,” argued Foenad.

“You have two other witnesses in your hands,” retorted Maiho. “They will confirm what Nolwark is saying.”

“Give it up, Foenad,” sighed Belshat. “We are beyond denial at this stage.” Belshat grimaced as if he had swallowed something unpleasant. “Perhaps we should think about Maiho’s suggestion.”

“That kind of a precedent,” Thiona hesitantly started. “Killing or enslaving Huifa ourselves is one thing, but letting outsiders do it makes me uncomfortable. If we give them Huifa, who’s next?”

“If you stop attacking Singers, no-one’s next,” growled Maiho. “You are the ones who started this.”

“I thought you hated Huifa, Thiona,” queried Belshat. “Surely you would love a chance to get rid of her.”

“And you’re her friend. Remind me not to get too friendly with you lest I suffer the same fate,” observed Thiona.

“You can’t do this! It isn’t right,” exclaimed Foenad.

“And attacking our friends and family in order to get more rods and stones is right?” asked Maiho.

“If we give up Huifa, isn’t that saying we are afraid of Huglek?” asked Thiona.

“Accepting the reality of the situation is no sin,” said Belshat.

“Don’t tell me that you’re afraid of this night rat?” said Thiona. “A crossbow bolt in the back will kill anyone.”

“No-one’s shooting anyone,” stated Maiho. “This is the kind of thing that got us in this situation in the first place.”

“And who’s going to kill him?” asked Belshat. “You don’t want to risk your precious cousins and friends.”

“I know someone,” said Thiona.

Maiho groaned and put her head in her hand. “Do I have to kill somebody in order to have anyone listen to me?” she asked. “If you are thinking of hiring the Shadow, he won’t take the job.” She hoped he wouldn’t take it.

“How do you know about the Shadow?” asked Thiona.

“It’s a small village besides. I have done healing work in the Scrambles,” commented Maiho.

“What has that got to do with anything?” asked Thiona. “And anyway, I heard he will kill anyone.”

“He will kill anyone the Gardener permits him to kill,” answered Maiho.  Which was one of a long list of reasons she really needed to talk to the Gardener fairly soon.

“The Gardener doesn’t ex-,” started Foenad.

“It doesn’t matter, because if there are further attacks we are going to blame you no matter who does it,” interrupted Maiho impatiently.

“You know, if we want to kill him, you need to stab him though the heart or through the eye into the brain,” mutter Foenad thoughtfully.

“What nonsense are you spouting now, Foenad?” asked Thiona.

“Foenad is right. The Cursed are supposed to be hard to kill,” said Belshat. “People tried to kill Viune plenty of times and Huglek had no trouble with dealing with ten enforcers, even though according to Nolwark’s story he was hit at least once.”

“If there are any more Singers attacked -“ Maiho warned.

“By Cursed, are you talking about the Evil Singers in plays that have glowing eyes, cackle while rubbing their hands and always get killed by the hero in the end of the play?” asked Thiona.

Foenad startled at Thiona’s words, looking in alarm at Maiho and Laivo.

“In real life they kill the hero, not the other way around,” stated Belshat.

“Does anyone pay the slightest attention to anything I say?” growled Maiho in frustration.

“Do you still need us, Healer?” asked one the guards. Nolwark and both his guards looked very uncomfortable with the turn the conversation had taken.

After confirming with Belshat, Foenad and Thiona that they were finished questioning Nolwark, Maiho dismissed them with a wave and they exited the room. She had wanted to use Nolwark to make a few more points, but she gave it up as a lost cause.
