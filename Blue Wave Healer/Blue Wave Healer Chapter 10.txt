Maiho warned Nargre that Huglek was coming out and explained the situation. She then let go of the hunters and found herself back in Laivo’s arms.

Maiho briefly closed her eyes, then tried to disentangle herself from Laivo, but Laivo would not let go. She was surprisingly strong.

“Time to get back to work,” announced Maiho.

“You have already done enough. You are exhausted,” countered Laivo.

“The work is not going to get done by itself. There are all those patients that didn’t get treated because I was busy with Raeha and I also have to stop Huglek killing off the senior families.”

“The aids have treated all the patients. They can all wait a little before they really need the altar. As for the senior families let Huglek kill them. What have they ever done for the village?" argued Laivo.

Maiho cupped Laivo's cheek and tilted her head so she could look into her eyes. "Do you really want the nest's corridors to flow red with blood? Do you have any idea how much death and destruction a Singer can inflict on others?" she asked. 

Laivo looked away saying “You need to look after yourself for once.” Maiho frowned and looked more closely at Laivo. Her eyes were glowing and her hair was standing up. She had a wild crazed look. Maiho wondered if this was what people saw when they looked at her.

Maiho had never given that much vitality to anyone before and Laivo was not used to it. “Are you okay?”

“I have never felt better. I’m all tingly. I feel like I can lift mountains, crush rocks. I feel wonderful,” said Laivo. “Do I have the lips?" she asked.

"The lips?" asked a confused Maiho.

"My mother has blue lips. Have mine gone blue?"

Maiho didn't understand and then she did. "Oh. Oh! Uhm no. That kind of thing usually takes a few hours. At least it did with Bardre."

"You did it with Bardre?"

"No. Similar effect, different uhm. Nevermind. So how did your mother - ?”

“Vuine.”

“Thank the gods.”

“Who did you think - ?”

“Never mind.” Maiho rolled and twisted, dumping Laivo on the floor.

“Hey!”

“The village isn’t going to save itself,” said Maiho, adjusting her beech-clout so that it covered her. She strode to the door, leaving Laivo to catch up. She almost ran into a guard as her opened the door.

“Sorry Instructor. Belshat is here,” said the guard hurriedly sidestepping.

“Put him in the big meeting room,” Maiho instructed. Tell him that I will be with him shortly. When Thiona and Foenad arrive put them in the same room. Where are Maksim and Nolwark?” 

“Consulting Room 4,” replied the guard.

“Do you really think Thiona and Foenad will come?” asked Laivo. “I’m amazed that Belshat came.”

“They will all be nervous about Huglek,” said Maiho. “They’ll come.” Turning to the guard she asked, “Can you find Tagran for me?”

“I don’t know what he looks like,” said the guard.

“He’s the Head Healer’s Aid here. His necklace will have one blue and two white crystals,” advised Maiho.

“I think I’ve seen him.”

“Good I’ll be in Consulting Room 4,” she replied. She headed towards room 4. She paused at the door and turned to Laivo asking. “Can you look scary?” 

Laivo responded by giving a grimace. Maiho shook her head “That just makes you look constipated. Try look predatory, like you want to eat the other person.”

Laivo batted her eyelids and looked coy.

Maiho groaned. “Never mind. Just be yourself. The eyes and hair will probably make them soil their beech-clouts anyway.”

“The way you look, they will be so terrified of you, they won’t even notice me,” said Laivo. With a slam of her palm the door swung open and they both entered the room.

After taking care of a few matters they both headed for the big meeting room. Belshat was pacing nervously while Foenad was seated at the table.

“Naedri’s mercy! There are two of them!” exclaimed Foenad.

Belshat spun around and did a double take. “What’s wrong with your eyes?” he asked.

“Its a side effect of saving Raeha’s life. It wasn’t easy,” replied Maiho.


“Radha’s alive. Huglek was screaming outside Huifa’s place that she had killed her.” Belshat  asked.

“She did, but I brought her back,” announced Maiho.


“Are you going to look like that from now on?” Belshat  asked.

“You have bigger problems. I wouldn’t worry about this if I were you,” stated Maiho, indicating her eyes.

“What are going to do about that madman who is threatening to kill my aunt?” asked Foenad.

“Why would I do anything about that?” asked Maiho.

“Your message said - “ began Foenad.

“I will help you resolve matters, but it will cost you,” stated Maiho.

“We are willing to pay 300 rods to get rid of him,” responded Foenad.

“Not that kind of cost,” warned Maiho. “Huifa will resign as head of your family in favour of you. She will be put on trial for conspiracy to commit murder. She will be sentenced to 30 hundred-days of enslavement.”

“Why don’t you ask for 100 hundred-days?” asked Foenad, bitterly. “My aunt is 64. She doesn’t have 30 hundred-days left.”

“We didn’t come here for you to play games with us,” said Belshat, pushing past them. “If you are not going to be serious I’m leaving.”

“I would go out there if I were you,” said Maiho. “You might run into Huglek.”

Belshat froze with his hand on the door handle. Thiona slammed the door into Belshat as she entered the room, sending him staggering back.

“What did I miss?” asked Thiona, ignoring Belshat. Only a slight smile betrayed that she realised that she had hit him with the door.

“Belshat and Foenad were just telling me that they would rather Huifa die than pay for her crimes,” said Maiho.

“The bitch doesn’t have enough skin to fray in order to pay for all her crimes,” said Thiona. “What has the screecher done now?”

“Show some respect,” said Belshat. “She is a senior family head.”

“Well I am too,” said Thiona. “But that magma snake has never shown {b}me{/b} any respect.”

“Shall we all sit down.” suggested Maiho.

“Is Huglek really here or was that another one of your games?” asked Belshat.

“Oh, he’s here alright,” said Thiona. “I just ran into to him. He’s visiting his wife. She’s ill.”

Belshat turned pale.

“Sit down Belshat,” commanded Maiho. Belshat was so stunned that he actually obeyed, sitting down in the next chair and placing his head in his hands.

“Whose is the twitch with the matching hair and eyes?” asked Thonia, pointing to Laivo.

“This is trainee healer Laivo,” said Maiho, “I’m showing her the ropes. We discussed Laivo’s appointment in the meeting you walked out of.” Laivo grimaced and opened her mouth to contradict Maiho. Maiho reached out and touched her hand, using the colour in her body as if it was a message crystal. “Play along,” Maiho send to her. Laivo was so startled by Maiho’s disembodied voice whispering in her ear that she gaped out mouthed fore a few seconds.

“And why to the both of you look like ghosts in a bad play,” asked Thiona.

“It’s due to the after effects of an intense healing season,” answered Maiho.

“Can we stop with the polite, but meaningless chit-chat and get on with the matter at hand?” asked Foenad.

“What do you want to talk about? Whether we are going to give into Maiho’s demands and make Huifa a scapegoat or allow Huglek to continue to wage war on the 4th family?” asked Belshat, in a morose tone.

“Things haven’t degenerated that far, have they?” asked Foenad.

“Oh! This meeting is much more interesting than the last one,” said Thiona. “I vote we scape the goat out of that witch. What {b}is{/b} a scapegoat by the way?”

“I don’t know. I’m not an Archivist. All I know is that they get blamed for things,” sighed Belshat.

“Why don’t we leave her out in the sunlight? Or burn her?” asked Thiona. “I’ll provide the wood.”

“You’re not as funny as you think you are Thiona,” said Belshat.

“There has to be another way,” said Foenad. “Are you telling me that the entire strength of the senior families can’t deal with an old ex-priest?”

“The demand for Huifa’ enslavement, is that coming from you or Huglek?” asked Belshat, looking at Maiho.

“I’m acting for Huglek,” replied Maiho.

“That’s an interesting choice of words. If we agree to offer up Huifa and let her be enslaved, will Huglek agree that the matter is closed?” asked Belshat.

“Belshat! We’re not charterless bandits. The village charter guarantees a trial,” protests Foenad.

“We have more than enough evidence to convict Huifa,” said Maiho. “That’s no problem. The problem is that trials go awry when the senior families are involved. In this case I want your guarantee that the trial will go smoothly and without interference.”

“So what exactly did Huifa do?” asked Thiona. “Does it have something to do with why there is a bunch of shard hunters hanging out in front of Haifa’s place?”

“Shard hunters! I didn’t hear about those. Does Huglek have shard hunters?” asked Belshat.

“The shard hunters are mine,” said Maiho.

“You’re helping Huglek?” asked Foenad.

“How did you get shard hunters?” asked Thiona “Their hasn’t been a caravan with shard hunters for several hundred days.”

“I’m helping the senior families and Huglek resolve their differences,” said Maiho.

“You still haven’t explained what happen,” said Thiona.

“Belshat and Huifa sent ten enforcers and two lookouts to waylay Huglek and kill him,” said Maiho.


“I had nothing to do with that,” protested Belshat.

“I have witnesses who say otherwise,” said Maiho.

“I didn’t think you and Huifa had the guts,” said Thiona. “I thought you would do nothing as usual.”

“I tried to convince Huifa that it was a bad idea. Did your witnesses tell you that?” asked Belshat, ignoring Thiona.

“You only did so because you thought it was too risky,” said Maiho. “Huifa wanted to send three enforcers. You convinced her to send ten. You even lent her three enforcers and a lookout for the job.”

“How did you scrounge up three enforcers - ?” started Thiona.

“When he had lost so many people in clashes with my parents and me, that he had to borrow a couple enforcers from you?” finished Maiho. “That’s simple. He lend your enforcers to Huifa.”

“You promised you wouldn’t use them against Singers,” accused Thiona.

“Actually I only promised not to use them against Maiho,” countered Belshat.

“What kind of fool do you think I am?” asked Thiona. “That nonsense wouldn’t satisfy a five hundred day old.”

“You are always criticising us for not doing anything. Well, we did something,” retorted Belshat.

“You treat me like a poor cousin, always telling me that I am too rash and too inexperienced. Well what has your great wisdom and experience brought us Belshat?” said Thiona. “Huglek looked pretty good when I just talked to him.”

Belshat gritted his teeth, but said nothing. 

“If Huglek is here. What has happen to my Aunt?” asked Foenad. “Wasn’t Huglek in her apartment, trying to - “

“Huifa is still hold up in her apartment. She is not going anywhere,” said Maiho.

“Tell us the rest of it,” said Thiona. “What happen to my men?”

“The lookouts both survived. Foenad and Belshat it would be good for us talk to them. They should be able add details to the sequence of events,” said Maiho. “Can you two find them and present them at follow-up meeting?”

“Why would we do that?” asked Belshat.

“If you trust my version of events, I guess there is no real reason to,” said Maiho.

“Just get on with it,” demanded Thiona. 

“Two of the enforcers were captured when they sought a healer’s help at this clinic.” said Maiho. “The remaining eight enforcers are probably dead. The guard is still collecting body parts from the scene of the conflict. The dead probably include your enforcers Thiona. I’m sorry.”

“Ragloc was my cousin. Jurlen has worked for the family since he was a child,” said Thiona.

“We have all lost people, Thiona,” said Belshat.

“Daylight burn you, Belshat. This is all your fault,” said Thiona.

“Huglek’s wife Raeha was shot with a crossbow during the conflict. The fact that she is still alive is the only reason he is willing to let you all live,” said Maiho.

“We don’t respond well to threats,” said Thiona.

“That wasn’t a threat, just a statement of fact,” said Maiho.

“How did Huglek manage to ambush the uhm team?” asked Thiona, “And where did he get the muscle to take down ten enforcers?”

“The family kill team ambushed Huglek,” answered Maiho. “He was taken completely by surprise.”

“Then who killed the enforcers?” asked Thiona.

“Huglek and his wife did,” said Maiho.

“Just two people against ten,” queried Thiona.

“Two Singers against 10 non-singers,” said Maiho. “They didn’t stand a chance.”

“Tube slush! Even with a powerful weapon that would be unlikely,” retorted Thiona.

“And Huglek’s wife isn’t a Singer,” add Foenad.

“Huglek was senior priest for tens of hundred-days, in that time don’t you think he would have acquired a weapon,” said Maiho. “As for Raeha, she is healer caste, and like all singer caste has been trained to sing.”

“I still don’t believe it,” stated Thiona.

“What is there to believe?” asked Maiho, in annoyance. “You are too used to dealing Logwan. You have forgotten how dangerous Vuine was, people were afraid of her for a reason. Did you think that all the stories were just that only stories. If Huglek hadn’t been taken by surprise he would have be able to kill all of your little murder squad with ease. He is not going to be taken by surprise again.” Her eyes flicked to the door. The door opened and two guards escorted Nolwark in.

“This is one of the two survivors of the altercation,” explained Maiho. “Nolwark would you explain what happened.”

Nolwark eyes flickered around the room each face he saw seemed to frighten him more than the last. He twisted in the guards grip searching for a way to escape.

“Its okay Nolwark. No-one is going to hurt you here,” reassured Maiho. “Just tell your story.”

Nolwark licked his lips and swallowed. 

“How did you find Huglek and his wife?” prompted Maiho.

“There’s a restaurant they go to. We hit them as they came out of the restaurant. Bagtav and Menfus went in with the the knifes,” said Nolwark.

“I told you to use crossbows,” exclaimed Belshat.

Everyone looked at Belshat. He shrunk down in his seat.

“Too many things a can go wrong with a crossbow,” said Nolwark. “It is easier to control the situation with a knife.”

“When Bagtav and Menfus closed the girl grabbed her flute except it wasn’t a flute that came out of the flute holder it looked like a shock wand but when she sang and hit Bagtav with it he fell down dead. I’ve never seen a shock wand do that.”

“How lethal a shock wand is depends on how strong the Singer is. Raeha is quite strong,” observed Maiho.

“She isn’t a Singer. It was illegal for her to sing,” said Thiona with a frown.

“It is completely legal for a singer cast member to Sing under the supervision of the Song Master. Or do you think that her husband is likely to refuse her permission?” asked Maiho.

“Your Father wasn’t supervised by the Song Master when he shocked poor Natlard,” complained Belshat. “He still has not completely recovered. Winfur hasn’t recovery from what your mother did to him either.”

“If I had realised earlier why Natlard and Winfur were banned from the clinic, they would have other problems,” said Maiho. “They are both free complain to the guard. Of course they might have to explain why they attacked my parents.”

“They only wanted to talk,” said Belshat.

“Threaten and intimidate more likely,” said Maiho.

“None of this helps my aunt,” complained Foenad. “We are willing to admit fault and pay compensation.”

“I have already told you the price,” stated Maiho.


“She is an old woman. Surely you can’t be so heartless to inflict this on her?” asked Foenad.

“This is the fourth time in the last few five-days that senior family has attacked Singers and their families. This time Raeha actually died, and although I saved her the odds of her making a significant recovery are not good. We have run out of patience. There must be real payment this time,” said Maiho. “Besides Huglek still wants Huifa dead. Now is a good time to ask for mercy. He is still grateful that she is alive and has not given up hope that she will recover. If you wait to long her life will not be worth a cracked chip”.


“When a non-singer or a week Singer uses a wand they will only be able shock someone, a strong Singer can kill someone, the strongest can cook somebody.”

Singers are not people you can provoke and you can’t always tell a strong singer


And the most dangerous type of Singer to provoke are Sources. A Source doesn’t age and will even become younger over time. Their eyes and even their patterns may glow
