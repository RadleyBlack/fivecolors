The two shard hunters disappeared down the side corridor up ahead. Maiho split her attention between the side branch and the turn further ahead. Her eyes flickering between them. She swapped the needle flinger to her left hand as her right was aching. The last thing she needed was for the needler to slip out of her partially crippled right hand at the wrong time. It had already happened once though thankfully not during battle.

Jep noticed the change and slipped behind her to stand on her new off hand side. Shifting the heavy shield to the other hand as he did so. He knew better than to stand in front of her when she was holding the needler.

She poked her head around the corner verifying that it was clear then sprinted to the other side of the intersection. Jep struggled to keep up, she didn't know how he managed to hold that shield for so long. 

Reaching the relative safety of the corner she glanced back to Loshven and Dret, she felt a sense of relief at only having to worry about being attacked from 2 directions instead of 3.

She sang a quick song to summon the shard hunters from the side corridor. She made it a sew steps further down the corridor before Jep tapped her on the shoulder. He pointed behind her with a flick of his chin.

With a sinking heart looked back to see Loshven gesturing like a manic toward the side corridor as if hadn't taken in his ill conceived intentions at a glance.

"No," she signed "Come this way."

She signed as he continued gesturing down the side corridor. 

"Come here now!" she signed with emphasis.

Loshven glared at her with irritation and gestured again. He seemed to have forgotten than she was in charge again. Tania had given him a talking the previous sleep cycle and put the fear of Orock into him. He had been obedient for a while, but it seemed to have worn off.

"Why," she asked herself, "was it that Illia, Tania and even jovial mild mannered Urthrem can make the juniors obey them, but when I try they looked at me as if I am some kind of cute harmless pet." The only senior who was worse at ordering the lost children about was Kin and at a full hundred day younger she was, he was one of the youngest escapees trapped in this nest.

Despite the fact that Loshven had no real experience in fighting the Reborn, he couldn't seem to understand why he was regarded as a junior singer while Maiho was considered a senior.

He regarded himself as superior because he was priest caste and she was only healer caste, plus he was two hundred day older, and she was a girl.

"That's the wrong way," she signed. "Its this way." Why did he have to start this now. This was one of the worst places to dawdle. She softly sang at the two green shard hunters sending one up ahead and one back down the side passage.

Loshven shook his head and repeated the same gestures.



"Naedri wept." she voicelessly muttered. Taking a deep breath she closed her eyes and schooled her features in her best imitation of an angry Tania. Opening them  she skewered Loshven with her best glare and signed vigorously "I am in charge. Follow orders."

"I can't understand you," he said way to loudly. Maiho ground her teeth and checked each direction. Sound travelled far to easily in these corridors.

Of course he didn't understand Red Blade Hand Talk, she had only been teaching him hand talk for the last few weeks. She growled quietly in frustration. Half the problem seem to be that hand talk came from the Red Blade tribe and half that it was Maiho who was teaching him.

"Silence!" she signed. "Hand talk only." From the way he narrowed his eyes and pursed his lips seemed to understand that. Why, oh why didn't Illia let her take Lethia or even Veuto  instead of Loshven. However Kin needed Lethia on his team. She was protective of Kin and listened to him despite the age difference. There was no way Loshven would listen to Kin as he was 9, a Red Blade Tribesman and wasn't even Singer caste though the Red's and the Seniors kept that part secret, telling the juniors than Kin was Priest caste. And Veuto was too weak and too unskilled, so Maiho was stuck with Loshven. At least they were both Blue Wave Tribe.

Dret was just as nervous about standing in the middle of an intersection as Maiho was. He tried to 'encourage' Loshven to move to the partial cover of the corner, but Loshven shrugged Dret off. Looking at him he was still determined to go in the wrong direction.

"Talk under cover," she signed gesturing at the Dret and Loshven to come closer. Loshven opened his mouth to say something before Dret covered it with his free hand. Loshven shoved him roughly away. The tall thin blue raise his fists and threatened the shorter stockier red.

Maiho fished a red fruit out of her pouch and threw it at Loshven, hitting him on the cheek. Both of them were scandalised. Dret at the waist of food and Loshven at being hit. Dret quickly retrieved the fruit, placing it in his own pouch.
